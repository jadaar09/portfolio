<h1>Just a Few Things I've Done</h1>

<p>I've done a lot of extracurricular activities in school. I was co-captain of my school's step team. The year before the team became official, I was a <br>
  part of the group of students who were in a smaller step show for Black History month. I was also part of a group of ambassadors for my school, the Tiger<br>
  Ambassadors(our school's mascot was tigers). As a part of this group it was my job to go out on trips to represent my school at important meetings; I also<br>
  gave tours for open house at my school. The thing I'm most proud of from being an amassador was giving a man a tour and he ended up working at the school.<br>
  The craziest part was taht I don't remeber giving him the tour; but one day at recess he walked up to me an dasked if I remebered givimg him the tour.
