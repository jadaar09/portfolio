<h1>What Was My Early Life Like?</h1>
<h2>A few Interesting Moments from My Life</h2>
<p>When I was younger I was a pretty good child. I listened to my parents and did what I was supposed to do...usually. I remeber a few <br>
   times when I was what some would call "mischevious". I remeber one day my sister Ashley was watching me while our mom was at work. We were <br>
   in the living room and she said she wa sgoing upstairs for a minute. When she went upstairs, I went into the kitchen and got some scisiors <br>
   and cut my hair. The night before, my mom had washed and braided my hair so she could put into a style when she go back home from work. <br>
   I cut two braids off and threw them in the trash and put the scisirs on the counter. A few minutes later my sister came back into the <br>
   kitchen  and asked me what happened. I just looked silently. She looked in the trash and saw my hair, I said "It fell out.". She called our <br>
   mom and started crying, thinking she would get in trouble. My mom was really chill about the situation and asked if I was ok, which I was, <br>
   so she said "Well it's hair. It'll grow back. I'll see y'all when I get home.". My sister just looked at me and walked away.</p>
<p>Another memory froom when I was very young is my first day of first grade. I went to a new school because  my old school was beiing turned <br>
   into a charter school and my mother didn't want me to go to a charter school. On the first day, my mother walked me into class and when she <br>
   was leaving I started crying. I cried for the first half of the day. I was five years old at the time. I reallly didn't like the school's vibe. <br>
   I know I was really young but i just didn't like the school. I stayed tehre until fifth grade,against my will, then went to a different school <br>
   for middle school. When I was in Middle school, I really felt like I fit in </p>
