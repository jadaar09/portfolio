<h1>What Was My Early Life Like?</h1>
<p>When I was younger I was a pretty good child. I listened to my parents and did what I was supposed to do...usually. I remeber a few <br>
   times when I was what some would call "mischevious". I remeber one day my sister Ashley was watching me while our mom was at work. We were <br>
   in the living room and she said she wa sgoing upstairs for a minute. When she went upstairs, I went into the kitchen and got some scisiors <br>
   and cut my hair. The night before, my mom had washed and braided my hair so she could put into a style when she go back home from work. <br>
   I cut two braids off and threw them in the trash and put the scisirs on the counter. A few minutes later my sister came back into the <br>
   kitchen  and asked me what happened. I just looked silently. She looked in the trash and saw my hair, I said "It fell out.". She called our <br>
   mom and started crying, thinking she would get in trouble. My mom was really chill about the situation and asked if I was ok, which I was, <br>
   so she said "Well it's hair. It'll grow back. I'll see y'all when I get home.". My sister just looked at me and walked away.</p>
   <p>Another memory I favor is when I got to go on a study abroad trip to Europe. Specifically Milan, Itally; Nice, France; and Barcelona, <br>
      Spain.</p>
