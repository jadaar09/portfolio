<h1>Who is Jada Richardson?</h1>

<h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>My name is Jada Alexis Richardson. I was born on September 24, 2002 at the Washington Hospital Center. I was born into a family <br>
   consisting of a mother, father, aunt, and older sister. My mother, Judy, had my sister, Ashley, 11 years before having me. I am my <br> 
   mother's second child, but my father's only child. On my mother's side I have 3 aunts: Avery, Kim, and Kathy; though Avery, Auntie A, <br>
   is who I am closest to out of all of them. My sister and I were pretty close growing up but we had our fare share of disputes, just <br>
    like all siblings.</p> <br> 
  <p>Where am I from? I used to hate being asked that question because my answer is a little complicated. I was born in Washington, D.C. <br>
     But I lived in Maryland until I was 14 years old. Yet I always went to school in D.C. So, when people would ask me where I'm from, <br>
     I would hav eto explain that and the yalways said "Oh so you're from D.C. then.". My response was always "Yea, I guess so." Other <br>
     times people ask me where I'm from and i tell them I'm from D.C. and of course they aask me what part an dI get stuck. So then I <br>
     have  to tell them the story of where I'm from.</p>
