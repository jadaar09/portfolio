<h1>Who is Jada Richardson?</h1>

<h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>My name is Jada Alexis Richardson. I was born on September 24, 2002 at the Washington Hospital Center. I was born into a family <br>
   consisting of a mother, father, aunt, and older sister. My mother, Judy, had my sister, Ashley, 11 years before having me. I am my <br> 
    mother's second child, but my father's only child. On my mother's side I have 3 aunts: Avery, Kim, and Kathy; though Avery, Auntie A, <br>
    is who I am closest to out of all of them. My sister and I were pretty close growing up but we had our fare share of disputes, just <br>
    like all siblings.</p>
