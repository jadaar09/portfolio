<title>Experiences That Helped Shape Me</title>

<p>Something that I feel really helped shape me was when I got to go on a study abroad trip to Europe. Specifically Milan, Itally; Nice, France; <br>
and Barcelona, Spain. I saw so many wonderful sites and saw so many cultural expressions when I was in each city. My favorite place of all though, <br>
was Itally. There, I went to Cinque Terre; which translates to The Five Lands. I only went to three of the five but my favorite was Manarola. It was <br>
so vibrnat and intriguing and I would love to go back there. In Nice, I got to see a park that was very beautiful. I wloved it so much and it was so <br>
big. There were so many different parts of the park that you could go to and there were lots of statues and there was even a playground. I really think <br
this experience shaped me because it allowed me so see and experience cultures other than my own. Also, it has allowed me to be exposed to something I've <br>
always wanted to do, travel. Ever since I was a little girl I've wanted to travel to different places around the world. </p>
